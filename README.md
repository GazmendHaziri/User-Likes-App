# User-Likes-App

A small application to save the users and likes of these users.

Database

I picked MySql database since I though this is the right database for saving the users, likes and keeping the relationship betweek users and likes. There are some pros and cons on using the MySql instead of NoSql database. In the MySql database it's easer to maintain the relationship between those two entities and also it gives us the flexibility to do advanced queries like sort the users based on likes, this comes with an excelent performance. Pros of using the NoSql would be the scaling and also dealing with the large number of requests, maintaining the MySql connections can be costy and also harder to scale.
